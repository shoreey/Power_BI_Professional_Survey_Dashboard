# Power BI Professional Survey Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project leverages Power BI to conduct a comprehensive analysis of survey data from data professionals, focusing on Data Scientists and Data Analysts.

## Technical Overview

### 1. Data Ingestion and Preprocessing
- Utilized Power Query M for advanced data cleaning and transformation
- Implemented custom functions for data standardization and error handling
- Applied conditional column creation for derived metrics

### 2. Data Modeling
- Developed a star schema model to optimize query performance
- Implemented calculated columns and measures using DAX for complex calculations
- Created hierarchies for multi-level analysis of career progression

### 3. Advanced Analytics
- Employed statistical measures such as correlation coefficients and regression analysis
- Utilized Power BI's built-in forecasting capabilities for projecting future trends

### 4. Visualization and Interactivity
- Designed an interactive dashboard with drill-through capabilities and custom tooltips
- Implemented bookmarks and page navigation for a guided analytics experience
- Utilized advanced DAX measures for dynamic KPI calculations

### 5. Performance Optimization
- Implemented query folding techniques to optimize data refresh processes
- Utilized incremental refresh for large datasets to improve load times
- Applied row-level security to ensure data privacy and personalized views

## Key Insights and Methodologies
- Conducted comparative analysis of salary distributions using box plots and violin plots
- Implemented skills gap analysis using heat map visualization
- Utilized scatter plots with regression lines to illustrate experience-salary correlations
- Employed funnel charts to visualize attrition rates at various career stages
- Implemented geospatial analysis to illustrate regional salary variations and job market hotspots

## Technical Challenges Overcome
